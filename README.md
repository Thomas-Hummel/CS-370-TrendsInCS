# CS-370-TrendsInCS
Current/Emerging Trends in Computer Science course. Largely AI.

* Briefly explain the work that you did on this project: What code were you given? What code did you create yourself?

This notebook demonstrates using AI to solve the Treasure Hunt game. It is a pathfinding AI. I was given the framework for the game as well as the basic neural net, but I had to add all of the code to implement a Deep Q-Learning algorithm.

* Connect your learning from throughout this course to the larger field of computer science:
  * What do computer scientists do and why does it matter?

Computer scientists design and implement computer systems to solve problems. Computers have become one of the most powerful tools that humans have, so being able to utilize them efficiently, effectively, and ethically is very important for our society.
  * How do I approach a problem as a computer scientist?

When faced with a problem as a computer science my first step is always to make sure that the problem is described accurately and completely. It's not very useful to solve the wrong problem. From there I tend to take a methodical approach to my software development efforts, breaking the problem into smaller pieces as necessary and making sure that each is solved.
  * What are my ethical responsibilities to the end user and the organization?

As a computer scientist I am ethically responsible to provide safe and effective solutions without causing undue harm to society.
